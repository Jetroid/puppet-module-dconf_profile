This module simply ensures that dconf is installed; a profile is added; and that the correct directories are present for keys to be added into.

dconf is used for low-level configuration and settings management.

This module does not manage any configuration itself - it merely ensured dconf is installed.

Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 64bit/32bit.
